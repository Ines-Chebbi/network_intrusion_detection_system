# network_intrusion_detection_system
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is designed to monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and policy violations. It analyzes data packets in real-time to detect potential threats, including known attack signatures and unusual behavior patterns. By providing alerts and detailed reports on suspicious activities, NIDS enables timely responses to security incidents. This system enhances network security by continuously assessing traffic and identifying potential breaches before they cause significant damage. Despite its effectiveness, NIDS can face challenges such as false positives and sophisticated evasion techniques.
